##My previous experience with python
I haven't wrote many programs with python until now.But I have known it for more than one year.One important reason is that I do not have onerous calculation tasks in my classes.Even if there is some homework of calculation or plotting,I can always solve it with mathematica.Therefore it is unnecessary for me to write program.

The time I fist met python is the year when I was a sophomore,and then I was focusing on my display in my classical dynamics.After referring to many books,I have much interest on chaos and prepared to show how a chaos pendulum works in my display.But a big problem was faced with me,that I had just learned a litte C and C++,plotting such a picture is difficult for me.

At that time,one of my teachers,Mr Zhou,proposed a book and at the same time,python for me,which is totally unknown for me.Installig python 2.7.6 in my linux visual box,I looked through the examples provided by the installation package.
