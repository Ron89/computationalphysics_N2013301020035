##My previous experience with python
I haven't wrote many programs with python until now.But I have known it for more than one year.One important reason is that I do not have onerous calculation tasks in my classes.Even if there is some homework of calculation or plotting,I can always solve it with mathematica.Therefore it is unnecessary for me to write program.
The time I fist met python is the year when I was a sophomore,and then I was focusing on my display in my classical dynamics.After referring to many books,I have much interest on chaos and prepared to show how a chaos pendulum works in my display.
