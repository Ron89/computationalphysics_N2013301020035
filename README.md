##My previous experience with python
I haven't wrote many programs with python until now.But I have known it for more than one year.One important reason is that I do not have onerous calculation tasks in my classes.Even if there is some homework of calculation or plotting,I can always solve it with mathematica.Therefore it is unnecessary for me to write program.
